# Welcome slide generator for Lansing tech events

This is the code behind [slide.lansing.codes](https://slide.lansing.codes), an
automatically-generated welcome slide for Lansing tech events.

It's intended to be a useful starting slide for event organizers to use at the
beginning of a tech event. The slide is bookmarkable, shows upcoming events,
wifi info, the main topic for the event, and sponsors. At least, eventually.
